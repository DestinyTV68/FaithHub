🕯Theme: Breaking The Syndrome Of Near Success For My Reign.

📖Text(s): Numbers 20:6-12

Prayer:
🛐Lord, I will not fail...

🛐My Father in Heaven, I break every cycle of near success, syndrome in my life, business, finances...

🛐My Father in Heaven, every evil altar speaking failure at the end of my breakthrough...catch Holy Ghost Fire now and scatter....

🛐Oh Lord, arise and scatter every demonic monitoring spirit assigned to my destiny, blessing, breakthrough... 

🛐My Father in Heaven, deliver me from inherited curse of delay, stagnation, disappointment, setback...

🛐My Father in Heaven, I command every red sea or hinderance between me and my next level to part now...

🛐My Father in Heaven, Step into my situation and let there be a supernatural turnaround...

🛐Oh Lord restore the years and the opportunities I have lost over the years...
